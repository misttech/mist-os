# DFv2 driver development documentation

The documentation in this section is designed to help driver developers create
new drivers using Fuchsia's [driver framework version 2][dfv2] (DFv2).

## How-to {:#how-to}

- [**Write a minimal DFv2 driver**][write-a-minimal-dfv2-driver]: Learn how to
  create a minimal DFv2 driver from scratch.
- [**Driver examples**][driver-examples]: Explore sample drivers intended to
  demonstrate various Fuchsia driver concepts.
- [**Composite nodes**][composite-node]: Learn how to create composite nodes in
  DFv2 using composite node specifications.

## Tutorials {:#tutorials}

- [**Bind rules tutorial**][bind-rules-tutorial]: Learn how to write bind rules
  for DFv2 drivers to discover and match devices.
- [**Bind library code generation tutorial**][bind-libraries-codegen]: Learn
  how to use bind libraries to auto-generate code for DFv2 drivers.
- [**FIDL tutorial**][fidl-tutorial]: Learn how to define FIDL protocols,
  export them from a driver, and use them in another driver.
- [**Metadata tutorial**][metadata-tutorial]: Learn how to pass metadata from
  one driver to another using the metadata library in DFv2.

## Debugging {:#debugging}

- [**Troubleshoot common issues in DFv2 driver development**][troubleshoot]:
  Learn how to debug and fix common errors in DFv2 driver development.
- [**Driver utilities**][driver-utils]: Learn how to use driver utilities for
  communicating with devices for diagnostics.

## Testing {:#testing}

- [**DriverTestRealm**][driver-test-realm]: Learn how to use the
  `DriverTestRealm` framework for running driver integration tests.
- [**Threading tips in tests**][treading-tips]: Understand best practices for
  handling threading in driver tests to avoid crashes.

## Best practices {:#best-practices}

- [**VMO registration pattern**][vmo-pattern]: Understand approaches for
  transferring bulk data between applications and drivers.
- [**Driver stack performance**][driver-stack-performance]: Understand
  performance-related best practices for authoring new device driver APIs.

## Guidelines {:#guidelines}

- [**Driver runtime API guidelines**][driver-runtime-api]: Follow these
  guidelines when defining C APIs in the driver runtime.
- [**Driver rubric**][driver-rubric]: Follow these rules when creating a
  new DFv2 driver in the Fuchsia source repository.

## Concepts {:#concepts}

- [**DMA (Direct Memory Access)**][dma]: Understand DMA and its importance in
  DFv2 driver development.
- For more information on DFv2-specific concepts, see [Drivers][dfv2]
  under the **Fundamentals** section.

## Additional information {:#additional-information}

See the following tutorials under the **SDK** section:

- [**Codelab: Build a driver**][driver-codelab]: Learn how to create a DFv2
  driver from scratch in the Fuchsia SDK environment.
- [**Write bind rules for a driver**][write-bind-rules]: Learn how to write
  bind rules for DFv2 drivers in the Fuchsia SDK environment.
- [**Driver unit testing quick start**][driver-unit-testing]: Learn how to
  write unit tests for DFv2 drivers in the Fuchsia SDK environment.
- [**View driver information**][view-driver-info]: Learn how to use the
  `ffx driver` command to retrieve information about drivers.
