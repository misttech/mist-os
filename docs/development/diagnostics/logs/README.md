# Logging on Fuchsia

The Logs from Fuchsia can be viewed interactively through `ffx log`.

Note: If you work on things such as bringup or diagnose issues with the network
stack, you may connect to a Fuchsia device through a serial console. In those
cases, you can use [`log_listener`][log-listener-ref] to view logs from the
device.

As you work with logs from a Fuchsia device, you can use `ffx log` to
retrieve logs from a device:

Note: For more information on using `ffx log`, see [`ffx log`][ffx-log-ref].

```posix-terminal
ffx log
```

To view specifics logs, you can use the `--filter` option. For example, to see
all logs tagged with `network`:

```posix-terminal
ffx log --filter network
```
