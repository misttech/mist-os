//! Safe Memory Mapped I/O for Fuchsia drivers.
//!
//! MMIO allows a program to interact with devices through operations on its address space. While
//! the interface is similar to regular memory access, there are some key semantic differences.
//! This crate provides safe interfaces for interacting with MMIO that are intended to be sound.
//!
//! # Memory semantics
//!
//! ## Safe Rust
//! The semantics of a safe Rust program are determined by the Rust Abstract Machine. The Rust
//! Abstract Machine notably does not provide certain guarantees that are required when interacting
//! with devices:
//!
//! - Guaranteed execution: I/O operations may be elided if the elision would have no impact on the
//! observable behavior of the executing thread (they may also be repeated).
//! - Operation ordering: operations may be reordered if doing so does not impact the observable
//! behavior of the executing thread.
//!
//! For memory that is under the control of the Rust Abstract Machine, the semantics of a safe Rust
//! program can depend on memory not changing value without a corresponding write.
//!
//! ## Device Memory
//! Device memory is not under the control of the Rust Abstract Machine. The guarantees around the
//! state and behavior of device memory do not provide the guarantees required for safe Rust.
//! Similarly, safe Rust cannot encode the semantics required to interact correctly with device
//! memory.
//!
//! ### Side Effects
//! Reading from or writing to device memory may have observable side effects, such as clearing a
//! status flag, advancing a buffer, or changing device state in some other way.
//!
//! ### Value Volatility
//! The value that would be returned when loading from a device memory address may change
//! completely independently of the program's control. Two subsequent reads on the same thread with
//! no interleaved write may return different values. A read of a just-written value is not
//! guaranteed to return the just-written value.
//!
//! ### Atomicity
//! A memory instruction which may be atomic when operating on regular memory is not guaranteed to
//! be atomic when interfacing with a device. For example a memory operation with a width larger
//! than the bus size supported by the device *must* be broken down into multiple operations.
//!
//! ### Elision and Spurious Accesses
//! As mentioned already, memory operations may be ellided or duplicated when executing safe Rust
//! provided they don't change the single-threaded semantics of the program. If a shared or mutable
//! reference to an object is active, memory operations may be performed to the backing memory. For
//! this reason accesses to a memory location via pointers should only be performed when there are
//! no active references that may alias the same memory.
//!
//! ### Compiler Reordering and Volatile
//! The Rust Compiler has some freedom to reorder instructions. For regular memory accesses the
//! compiler may reorder instructions where a data dependency does not prevent the reordering.
//!
//! The compiler is not allowed to reorder `volatile` operations with respect to other `volatile`
//! operations in the same thread. It is free to reorder `volatile` operations with other kinds of
//! memory accesses.
//!
//! By themselves, `volatile` operations cannot provide any sequencing guarantees with respect to
//! non-volatile operations on the same thread, or *any* kind of operation on another thread.
//!
//! # User Guide
//!
//! Users of this crate interact with device memory through the `Mmio` trait. This trait exposes
//! the low-level load and store operations to safely interact with device memory. All stores
//! performed through an `Mmio` instance are issued through a mutable reference.
//!
//! If an `Mmio` implementation also implements `MmioSplit`, it is possible to split off
//! independently owned sub-regions from it. This allows concurrent mutable access to disjoint
//! MMIO regions.
//!
//! ## Operand Types
//! The `Mmio` trait provides load and store operations for the following types:
//!
//! - u8
//! - u16
//! - u32
//! - u64
//!
//! Conforming implementations of `Mmio` must perform these operations in the code order relative
//! to each other on the same thread, and in 1:1 correspondence with calls to corresponding
//! function.
//!
//! Where the operand type is larger than the bus size, an implementation should perform the
//! sub-operations in increasing address order.
//!
//! ## Dyn Compatibility and Trait Extensions
//! The `Mmio` trait is dyn compatible. Callers may want to also import the `MmioExt` trait which
//! defines some useful utilities on top of `Mmio` that would otherwise break dyn compatibility.
//! This trait is implemented automatically for any `Mmio`.
//!
//! ## Alignment
//! The `Mmio` trait exposes offsets instead of addresses. Operations must be performed at a
//! suitable offset for the operand type. Valid alignment is not an intrinsic property of an offset.
//! Callers can use `Mmio::align_offset` to determine the first offset within the MMIO region
//! suitable for a given alignment.
//!
//! # Implementers Guide
//! Implementers of `Mmio` and `MmioSplit` are required to uphold some guarantees. These are
//! discussed more thoroughly in the corresponding trait's documentation. These requirements are
//! intended to guarantee the semantics required to interface with devices correctly, as discussed
//! earlier.
