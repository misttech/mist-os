/// An `Mmio` implementation provides access to an MMIO region.
///
/// # Device memory
/// For implementations that provide access to device memory, all memory must be accessed with
/// volatile semantics. I/O instructions should not be coalesced or cached and should occur in
/// program order.
///
/// Implementations are not required to provide any ordering guarantees between device memory
/// access and other instructions. Furthermore there is no guarantee that any side-effects are
/// visible to subsequent operations.
///
/// Callers who need guarantees around instruction ordering and side-effect visibility should
/// insert the appropriate compiler fences and/or memory barriers.
///
/// # Safety
/// Implementations of `Mmio` are required to be safe in a Rust sense, however loads may have
/// side-effects and device memory may change outside of the control of the host.
///
/// # Offsets, Alignment and Capacity
/// Mmio implementations provide access to device memory via offsets, not addresses. There are no
/// requirements on the alignment of offset `0`.
///
/// When using the load and store operations, callers are required to provide offsets representing
/// locations that are suitably aligned and fully within bounds of the location. Failure to do so
/// does not cause any safety issues, but may result in errors for the checked loads and stores, or
/// panics for the non-checked variants.
///
/// If these guarantees can't be provided statically for a given use case, the following functions
/// can be used to ensure these requirements:
///
/// - `MmioExt::check_aligned_for<T>`: returns an `MmioError::Unaligned` error if the given offset is
/// not suitably aligned.
/// - `MmioExt::check_capacity_for<T>`: returns an `MmioError::OutOfRange` error if there is not
/// sufficient capacity at the given offset.
/// - `MmioExt::check_suitable_for<T>`: returns an `MmioError` if there is not sufficient capacity at
/// the given offset or it is not suitably aligned.
