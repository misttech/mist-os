//! Support for implementing splittable MMIO regions.
//!
//! This module defines the [MmioRegion] type which provides safe [Mmio] and [MmioSplit]
//! implementations on top of the more relaxed [UnsafeMmio] trait.
//!
//! The [UnsafeMmio] trait allows mutations through a shared reference, provided the caller
//! ensures that store operations are not performed concurrently with any other operation that may
//! overlap it.
//!
//! Implementing [UnsafeMmio] correctly is likely to be simpler than implementing [Mmio] and
//! [MmioSplit] for many use cases.

///
/// The safety constraints of [UnsafeMmio] require callers to ensure that stores are not performed
/// concurrently with loads for any overlapping range.

/// This type meets these requirements while supporting being split into independently owned due to
/// the following:
///
/// 1. An MmioRegion has exclusive ownership of a sub-region from the wrapped [UnsafeMmio]
///    implementation (required by [MmioRegion::new]).
/// 2. An MmioRegion only performs operations that are fully contained within the region it owns.
/// 3. All stores are performed through a mutable reference (ensuring stores are exclusive with all
///    other operations to the owned region).
/// 4. When splitting off `MmioRegions`, the split_off region owns a range that was owned by region
///    it was split off from prior to the split, and that it has exclusive ownership of after the
///    split.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// An MmioRegion is parameterized by two types:
/// - `Impl`: the [UnsafeMmio] implementation wrapped by this region.
/// - `Owner`: an object with shared ownership of the `Impl` instance.
