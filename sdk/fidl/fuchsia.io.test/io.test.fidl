/// associated filesystem servers with the described directory layout,
/// allowing their implementation of `fuchsia.io` and `fuchsia.io2` protocols
/// to be verified by a common test suite.
///
/// Different test cases will not interact with one another during the
/// conformance test, and only one test case will be active at a time per
/// tested filesystem. So it is possible to host all cases as different
/// sub-directories under a common filesystem instance, to simplify the
/// lifecycle and implementation.

/// to obtain the directory in its original state. In other words, repeated
/// test case set up should "as-if" yield new directories.

/// testing.
///
/// `HarnessConfig` lets the test harness modulate the set of expected outcomes and
/// behaviors validated by the test suite, by declaring specific properties
/// about the filesystem implementation. For example, setting [`ImmutableFile`]
