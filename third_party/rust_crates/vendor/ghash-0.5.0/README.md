[GHASH][1] is a [universal hash function][2] which operates over GF(2^128) and
can be used for constructing a [Message Authentication Code (MAC)][3].

Its primary intended use is for implementing [AES-GCM][4].

## Security Notes

This crate has received one [security audit by NCC Group][5], with no significant
findings. We would like to thank [MobileCoin][6] for funding the audit.

All implementations contained in the crate are designed to execute in constant
time, either by relying on hardware intrinsics (i.e. AVX2 on x86/x86_64), or
using a portable implementation which is only constant time on processors which
implement constant-time multiplication.

It is not suitable for use on processors with a variable-time multiplication
operation (e.g. short circuit on multiply-by-zero / multiply-by-one, such as
certain 32-bit PowerPC CPUs and some non-ARM microcontrollers).
