// Page provider implementation that provides requested loaned physical pages.
//
// This is used by contiguous VMOs which have had pages decommitted, when the pages are again
// committed.  The reason we use a PageProvider for this is it lines up well with the pager model in
// the sense that a page request can be processed while not holding the contiguous VMO's lock.
//
// PhysicalPageProvider always operates async (similar to PagerProxy), because we'd like to (in
// typical non-overlapping commit/decommit usage) have one batch that covers the entire commit,
// regardless of the fact that some of the pages may already be free and therefore could be
// immediately obtained.  Quite often at least one page will be presently owned by a different
// VMO, so we may as well always do one big async batch that deals with all the presently
// non-FREE pages.
