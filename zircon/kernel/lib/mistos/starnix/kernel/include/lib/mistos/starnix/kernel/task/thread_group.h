/// A collection of `Task` objects that roughly correspond to a "process".
///
/// Userspace programmers often think about "threads" and "process", but those concepts have no
/// clear analogs inside the kernel because tasks are typically created using `clone(2)`, which
/// takes a complex set of flags that describes how much state is shared between the original task
/// and the new task.
///
/// If a new task is created with the `CLONE_THREAD` flag, the new task will be placed in the same
/// `ThreadGroup` as the original task. Userspace typically uses this flag in conjunction with the
/// `CLONE_FILES`, `CLONE_VM`, and `CLONE_FS`, which corresponds to the userspace notion of a
/// "thread". For example, that's how `pthread_create` behaves. In that sense, a `ThreadGroup`
/// normally corresponds to the set of "threads" in a "process". However, this pattern is purely a
/// userspace convention, and nothing stops userspace from using `CLONE_THREAD` without
/// `CLONE_FILES`, for example.
///
/// In Starnix, a `ThreadGroup` corresponds to a Zicon process, which means we do not support the
/// `CLONE_THREAD` flag without the `CLONE_VM` flag. If we run into problems with this limitation,
/// we might need to revise this correspondence.
///
/// Each `Task` in a `ThreadGroup` has the same thread group ID (`tgid`). The task with the same
/// `pid` as the `tgid` is called the thread group leader.
