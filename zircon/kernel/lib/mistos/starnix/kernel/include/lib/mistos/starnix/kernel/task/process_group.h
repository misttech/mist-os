///
/// When a signal is sent to a process group, it is delivered to all processes in the group,
/// including the process group leader. This allows a single signal to be used to control all
/// processes in a group, such as stopping or resuming them all.

/// Process groups are also used for job control. The foreground and background process groups of a
/// terminal are used to determine which processes can read from and write to the terminal. The
/// foreground process group is the only process group that can read from and write to the terminal
/// at any given time.
///
/// When a process forks from its parent, the child process inherits the parent's PGID. A process
/// can also explicitly change its own PGID using the setpgid() system call.
///
/// Process groups are destroyed when the last process in the group exits.
