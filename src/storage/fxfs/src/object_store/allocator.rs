//! # The Allocator
//!
//! The allocator in Fxfs is filesystem-wide entity responsible for managing the allocation of
//! regions of the device to "owners" (which are `ObjectStore`).
//!
//! Allocations are tracked in an LSMTree with coalescing used to merge neighboring allocations
//! with the same properties (owner and reference count). As of writing, reference counting is not
//! used. (Reference counts are intended for future use if/when snapshot support is implemented.)
//!
//! There are a number of important implementation features of the allocator that warrant further
//! documentation.
//!
//! ## Byte limits
//!
//! Fxfs is a multi-volume filesystem. Fuchsia with fxblob currently uses two primary volumes -
//! an unencrypted volume for blob storage and an encrypted volume for data storage.
//! Byte limits ensure that no one volume can consume all available storage. This is important
//! as software updates must always be possible (blobs) and conversely configuration data should
//! always be writable (data).
//!
//! ## Reservation tracking
//!
//! Fxfs on Fuchsia leverages write-back caching which allows us to buffer writes in RAM until
//! memory pressure, an explicit flush or a file close requires us to persist data to storage.
//!
//! To ensure that we do not over-commit in such cases (e.g. by writing many files to RAM only to
//! find out tha there is insufficient disk to store them all), the allocator includes a simple
//! reservation tracking mechanism.
//!
//! Reservation tracking is implemented hierarchically such that a reservation can portion out
//! sub-reservations, each of which may be "reserved" or "forgotten" when it comes time to actually
//! allocate space.
//!
//! ## Fixed locations
//!
//! The only fixed location files in Fxfs are the first 512kiB extents of the two superblocks that
//! exist as the first things on the disk (i.e. The first 1MiB). The allocator manages these
//! locations, but does so using a 'mark_allocated' method distinct from all other allocations in
//! which the location is left up to the allocator.
//!
//! ## Deallocated unusable regions
//!
//! It is not legal to reuse a deallocated disk region until after a flush. Transactions
//! are not guaranteed to be persisted until after a successful flush so any reuse of
//! a region before then followed by power loss may lead to corruption.
//!
//! e.g. Consider if we deallocate a file, reuse its extent for another file, then crash after
//! writing to the new file but not yet flushing the journal. At next mount we will have lost the
//! transaction despite overwriting the original file's data, leading to inconsistency errors (data
//! corruption).
//!
//! These regions are currently tracked in RAM in the allocator.
//!
//! ## Allocated but uncommitted regions
//!
//! These are allocated regions that are not (yet) persisted to disk. They are regular
//! file allocations, but are not stored on persistent storage until their transaction is committed
//! and safely flushed to disk.
//!
//! ## TRIMed unusable regions
//!
//! We periodically TRIM unallocated regions to give the SSD controller insight into which
//! parts of the device contain data. We must avoid using temporary TRIM allocations that are held
//! while we perform these operations.
//!
//! ## Volume deletion
//!
//! We make use of an optimisation in the case where an entire volume is deleted. In such cases,
//! rather than individually deallocate all disk regions associated with that volume, we make
//! note of the deletion and perform special merge operation on the next LSMTree compaction that
//! filters out allocations for the deleted volume.
//!
//! This is designed to make dropping of volumes significantly cheaper, but it does add some
//! additional complexity if implementing an allocator that implements data structures to track
//! free space (rather than just allocated space).
//!
//! ## Image generation
//!
//! The Fuchsia build process requires building an initial filesystem image. In the case of
//! fxblob-based boards, this is an Fxfs filesystem containing a volume with the base set of
//! blobs required to bootstrap the system. When we build such an image, we want it to be as compact
//! as possible as we're potentially packaging it up for distribution. To that end, our allocation
//! strategy (or at least the strategy used for image generation) should prefer to allocate from the
//! start of the device wherever possible.
