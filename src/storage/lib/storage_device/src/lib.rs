//! `storage_device` provides a higher-level portable API ([`Device`]) for interacting with block
//! devices.  This library also provides the [`Buffer`] type which is a contiguous, splittable
//! transfer buffer allocated out of a shared pool which can be used for I/O.
//!
//! The two main implementations are
//!   - [`block_device::BlockDevice`], which is backed by a [`block_client::Device`] and used on
//!     Fuchsia devices, and
//!   - [`file_backed_device::FileBackedDevice`], which is backed by a regular file and is portable.
