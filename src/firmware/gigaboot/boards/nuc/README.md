# Fuchsia Firmware on NUC

This document contains NUC specific firmware workflows and features.

## Bootstrap Fuchsia with GBL

This section gives instructions for bootstrapping NUC boards using the Generic
Bootloader(GBL) EFI application, which will replace the recovery-installer
workflow. The doc assumes that the NUC device has already enabled USB booting
using
[these instructions](../../../../../docs/development/hardware/intel_nuc.md#enable-efi-booting-on-the-nuc).

1. Get the latest GBL prebuilts for x64 `gbl_x86_64.efi` from
[Android Build Artifact](https://ci.android.com/builds/branches/aosp_uefi-gbl-mainline/grid).

1. Configure Fuchsia to build with the GBL installer image.

   ```
   fx set core.x64 \
      --args=gigaboot_gbl_efi_app='"<absolute path to gbl_x86_64.efi>"' \
      --with //src/firmware/gigaboot/cpp:gbl-installer
   ```

1. Build Fuchsia.

   ```
   fx build
   ```

1. Create a bootable USB drive with the GBL installer.

   ```
   fx mkinstaller --gbl <path to usb drive>
   ```

1. Boot NUC from the USB drive. Wait until the device appears as a Fastboot
devices in `ffx target list`.

   Sample output for `ffx target list`
   ```
   NAME                      SERIAL          TYPE       STATE           ADDRS/IP                           RCS
   fuchsia-4821-0b31-eaf8*   <unknown>       Unknown    Fastboot        [fe80::4a21:bff:fe31:eaf8%eno2]    N
   ```
   Take the ip6 address from the above i.e. `fe80::4a21:bff:fe31:eaf8%eno2`

1. Run the following fastboot command to list all fastboot variables.

   ```
   fx fastboot -s tcp:<ip6 address> getvar all
   ```

   For example, using the example ip6 address from the previous step:
   ```
   fx fastboot -s tcp:fe80::4a21:bff:fe31:eaf8%eno2 getvar all
   ```

   In the output, look for variables that begin with `"block-device"` to find
   out the block devices detected on this device.

   For example:

   ```
   $ fx fastboot -s tcp:fe80::4a21:bff:fe31:eaf8%eno2 getvar all
   (bootloader) max-download-size: 0x20000000
   (bootloader) version-bootloader: 1.0
   (bootloader) max-fetch-size: 0xffffffffffffffff
   (bootloader) block-device:0:total-blocks: 0x1dcf32b0
   (bootloader) block-device:0:block-size: 0x200
   (bootloader) block-device:0:status: idle
   (bootloader) block-device:1:total-blocks: 0x3bb4000
   (bootloader) block-device:1:block-size: 0x200
   (bootloader) block-device:1:status: idle
   (bootloader) gbl-default-block: None
   (bootloader) partition-size:gbl-installer.esp/1: 0x3f00000
   (bootloader) partition-type:gbl-installer.esp/1: raw
   (bootloader) hw-revision: x64
   all:
   Finished. Total time: 0.049s
   ```

   The above example output shows that the device has two block devices, with
   numeric ID `0` and `1` respectively. Note that because we boot from USB,
   one of them is a USB disk which will not be our target disk for bootstrap.
   To tell which one is USB, look for variable
   `partition-type:gbl-installer.esp`, which gives the size and block device
   ID of the `"gbl-installer.esp"` partition on the USB disk. In the above
   example, it is
   ```
   (bootloader) partition-size:gbl-installer.esp/1: 0x3f00000
   ```
   which indicates that block device `1` is the USB disk. Therefore, this
   leaves only one possible disk candidate for bootstrap, which is block
   device `0`.

1. Flash GPT to the target block device.

   ```
   fx fastboot -s tcp:<ip6 address> flash gpt/<block device ID> gpt.bin
   ```

   where `<block device ID>` is the block device ID determined from the
   previous step. The file `gpt.bin` comes from the same directory as this doc.

   For example:

   ```
   fx fastboot -s tcp:fe80::4a21:bff:fe31:eaf8%eno2 flash gpt/0 gpt.bin
   ```

   After this step, the device should now have the needed partitions for
   flashing. It can be be manually verified by running `getvar all`.

1. Flash the device.

   ```
   fx flash --no-bootloader-reboot
   ```

1. After flash completes and device successfully boots into Fuchsia. Unplug the
USB disk.

## gpt.bin

The GPT image `gpt.bin` in this directory is generated by script
[gen_nuc_gpt.py](./gen_nuc_gpt.py) and contains the following partitions.
