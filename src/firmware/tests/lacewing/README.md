# Firmware Lacewing tests

This directory contains firmware Lacewing tests, which allows us to exercise the
device in fastboot mode to verify behavior.

The primary purpose here is for developer workflows that are not regularly
tested in infra, e.g. things like `getvar` variables.

## Supported devices

Any physical device should work as long as it supports:

* rebooting from an SSH shell into the bootloader (i.e. `dm reboot bootloader`)
* fastboot over USB or TCP

## Run manually

1.  Add the test to your `fx set` command:

    ```shell
    $ fx set ... --with-host //src/firmware/tests/lacewing
    ```

    Or to edit the current args with `fx args` instead, add `"//src/firmware/tests/lacewing"` to
    `host_labels` (note: *not* `host_test_labels`, that will not work).

2.  Put the device in Fuchsia mode, with SSH configured properly.

    The tests always expect the device to start fully booted, and need to be
    able to shell in remotely to reboot into fastboot mode.

3.  Run the tests:

    ```
    $ fx test //src/firmware/tests/lacewing --e2e --output
    ```
