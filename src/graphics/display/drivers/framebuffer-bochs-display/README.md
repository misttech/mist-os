# Bochs Framebuffer Display Driver

This is a display driver for display engines compatible with the [Bochs display
engine API][bochs-display-engine-api].

The Bochs display engine (also known as Bochs Graphics Adapter, BGA) is a
display engine that supports the VESA Bios Extension (VBE) standard, originally
used in the [Bochs][bochs] emulator. Some other emulators, including
[QEMU][qemu], also implement a `bochs-display` engine that is fully compatible
with the Bochs VBE Display API.

## Manual testing

We do not currently have automated integration tests. Behavior changes in this
driver must be validated using this manual test.

1. Launch a QEMU-based emulator.

   ```posix-terminal
   fx qemu -g -N --no-virtio
   ```

2. Launch the `squares` demo in the `display-tool` test utility.

   ```posix-terminal
   ffx target ssh display-tool squares
   ```

3. Add the following footer to your CL description, to document having performed
   the test.

   ```
   Test: ffx target ssh display-tool squares
   ```

These instructions will work with a `workbench_eng.x64` build that includes the
`//src/graphics/display:tools` GN target. The `//src/graphics/display:tests`
target is also recommended, as it builds the automated unit tests.

```posix-terminal
fx set --auto-dir workbench_eng.x64 --with //src/graphics/display:tools \
    --with //src/graphics/display:tests
```
