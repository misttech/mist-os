  <!--
  A minimal checkout including only mist-os.git itself.

  This manifest is intended to be used by rollers that need to update
  mist-os.git. It uses a shallow clone of mist-os.git to avoid downloading
  history that's not needed for a simple roll CL.

  This duplicates the mist-os.git manifest entry in the `platform` manifest
  because that one has a `githooks` entry pointing into //integration, but we
  want to be able to check out mist-os without integration.
